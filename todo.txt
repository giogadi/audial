Spiky bits:
- Player MUST have their volume setup correctly. This means either:
  - narrow the dynamic range; or
  - do a sound check at the beginning based on the loudest sound in the level
- the starting push node, ugh
- Section2 is too hard, maybe need to ramp up to that
- Maybe start thinking about multiple paths in the first section?
- !!!!!!different symbols for each node behavior!!!!!!
- maybe disable controller inputs for now

Ideas
- Everytime you die, change the patch a bit to keep things interesting
- let player sing into the mic to get vocoder shit
- Unlock levels and things by finding the right patch
- Make something work at any tempo the player wants
- Use Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence music in ryuichi's memory of what he initially imagined film music would be like
- push nodes that work like springs: pull into the node, and then it pushes back
- do vocals that say the letters being typed, just for shits and giggles.
  - could be luci saying the letters
- longer "enemies" that can act like sliders: the current position in the word is the setting of the slider, and you can type to go forward or back
  - maybe can use them as platforms or walls that change length? 

Near-term ideas:
- New section at beginning of hangout: moving platforms, but with shorter words/sequences. kinda build up to the main "riff".
- add fun and weird shader effects (mirror, upside down, whatever) with every loop in the hangout buildup

BUGS:
- Our controller support is SUPER BUSTED, DUDE!!!!! But that's a later problem.

TOOLS:
- Support SynthParams in BeatTimeEvents
- Enable setting a new global beat time epoch
- Save to file in a separate thread
- VST of my synth

Optimizations/improvements/etc:
- Use an arena when loading so we don't have all this allocations for GetChildren().
- DELAY ON PCM PLAYBACK!!!!
