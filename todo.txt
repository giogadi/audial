Spiky bits:
- Player MUST have their volume setup correctly. This means either:
  - narrow the dynamic range; or
  - do a sound check at the beginning based on the loudest sound in the level
- maybe disable controller inputs for now

Ideas
- AESTHETIC: Fever Ray's ARTE show
- Everytime you die, change the patch a bit to keep things interesting
- let player sing into the mic to get vocoder shit
- Unlock levels and things by finding the right patch
- Make something work at any tempo the player wants
- Use Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence music in ryuichi's memory of what he initially imagined film music would be like
- push nodes that work like springs: pull into the node, and then it pushes back
- do vocals that say the letters being typed, just for shits and giggles.
  - could be luci saying the letters
- longer "enemies" that can act like sliders: the current position in the word is the setting of the slider, and you can type to go forward or back
  - maybe can use them as platforms or walls that change length?
- bocuma
- have player type out the narrative, dialog, etc
- snake game with percussion
  - can go straight or turn left/right. Each has a perc instrument that maybe replaces whatever the default perc sound is. Gotta navigate an environment
- intro song to BGGOAT ep of insert credit

Story:
- In a world where the only way to die is to satisfy a goal assigned to you at birth. Maybe it’s a vague clue, maybe it’s obvious. Maybe hard, maybe easy. Maybe you disagree with it.
- The game is told in 2nd person: you are playing this game I made. You are under my control. Whatever. And extra paths where the player contradicts the voice are more challenging. Maybe they are how you actually progress - by choosing the paths where you rebel.
- tension between independence and control? constraint and freedom?

Near-term ideas:
- add Sonic 2/3 style intro panel at level start
- different instruments sometimes, obviously
- way more variety in notes from pickups. Maybe they even correlate to the notes the player is playing?
- Change letters sometimes for nodes as you go
- change positions of letters sometimes. Moving letters?
- make some nodes be words (type whole thing for them to activate)
- one-time-use nodes?
- wall that reflects you back to the node you dashed from (and you stop at that node)
- Change color of letterbox
- What if we prime the player with an example rhythm and then let them go at it themselves?
- add fun and weird shader effects (mirror, upside down, whatever) with every loop in the hangout buildup

BUGS:
- Our controller support is SUPER BUSTED, DUDE!!!!! But that's a later problem.
- weird floaty text when camera moves. everything looks floaty actually

TOOLS:
- collapse all for vectors
- Copy transform (and/or parts of it)
- faster input of notes and letters for lots of enemies
- need a window list so we know all the types of windows we can show
- need an input mode list so we know all the types of modes, and which is active, etc
- type in to search for entity type and seqAction type
- input midi note from keyboard piano
- up/down by octave for midi note input
- group all the room-transition-related things into one entity that's easy to set up.
- multiediting FOR REAL DUDE WTF
- make soundbank not shit
- DICTIONARY
- imgui EditorId selector that can constrain to a specific type
- "musical savestates" that will change patches, launch sequencers, etc for editing
- Find a way to set lengths based on musical timings more easily.
- Support SynthParams in BeatTimeEvents
- Enable setting a new global beat time epoch
- Save to file in a separate thread
- VST of my synth
- make platform its own entity
- switch between edit/play without closing program
- dropdown for model select
- dropdown for patch select for intvariable (and others?)
- figure out stable euler angles. use that code you saw once

Optimizations/improvements/etc:
- stepsequencer that lives inside the audio thread and has all the channels
- Allow Solo/Mute/Gain on seq tracks.
- velocity should use exponential curve
- Use an arena when loading so we don't have all this allocations for GetChildren().
- DELAY ON PCM PLAYBACK!!!!
- better font handling
