Spiky bits:
- Should consider unifying all platform velocities so players can get muscle memory
	- OR maybe visualize in some other way how many beats it'll take to cross a section. That could even be showing little "beat waypoints" for a platform's path?!?!?!
- Player MUST have their volume setup correctly. This means either:
  - narrow the dynamic range; or
  - do a sound check at the beginning based on the loudest sound in the level
- the starting push node, ugh
- Section2 is too hard, maybe need to ramp up to that
- Maybe start thinking about multiple paths in the first section?
- !!!!!!different symbols for each node behavior!!!!!!
- maybe disable controller inputs for now

Ideas
- Everytime you die, change the patch a bit to keep things interesting
- let player sing into the mic to get vocoder shit
- Unlock levels and things by finding the right patch
- Make something work at any tempo the player wants
- Use Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence music in ryuichi's memory of what he initially imagined film music would be like
- push nodes that work like springs: pull into the node, and then it pushes back
- do vocals that say the letters being typed, just for shits and giggles.
  - could be luci saying the letters
- longer "enemies" that can act like sliders: the current position in the word is the setting of the slider, and you can type to go forward or back
  - maybe can use them as platforms or walls that change length? 

Near-term ideas:
- bigger enemy that you dash toward, but more slowly.
- Change color of letterbox
- What if we prime the player with an example rhythm and then let them go at it themselves?
- add fun and weird shader effects (mirror, upside down, whatever) with every loop in the hangout buildup

BUGS:
- Our controller support is SUPER BUSTED, DUDE!!!!! But that's a later problem.

TOOLS:
- type in to search for entity type and seqAction type
- input midi note from keyboard piano
- up/down by octave for midi note input
- group all the room-transition-related things into one entity that's easy to set up.
- multiediting FOR REAL DUDE WTF
- make soundbank not shit
- DICTIONARY
- imgui EditorId selector that can constrain to a specific type
- "musical savestates" that will change patches, launch sequencers, etc for editing
- Find a way to set lengths based on musical timings more easily.
- Support SynthParams in BeatTimeEvents
- Enable setting a new global beat time epoch
- Save to file in a separate thread
- VST of my synth
- make platform its own entity
- switch between edit/play without closing program
- dropdown for model select
- dropdown for patch select for intvariable (and others?)
- figure out stable euler angles. use that code you saw once

Optimizations/improvements/etc:
- Allow Solo/Mute/Gain on seq tracks.
- velocity should use exponential curve
- Use an arena when loading so we don't have all this allocations for GetChildren().
- DELAY ON PCM PLAYBACK!!!!
- better font handling
- avoid allocations when drawing enemy text
